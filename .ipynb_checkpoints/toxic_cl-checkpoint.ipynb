I said fucking sorry for my little brother and you still had to fucking complain. My life is fucking shit. My mother is always yelling at me and my dad beats the shit out of me if I get fucking out of line. My brother's one outlet is wikipedia. He cried when he saw my father smacking me, and his tears clogged his mac book pro's keyboard. we had to go to fucking apple and get a new one, all out of my mom's pocket. then last night i wanted to take this hot pussy from connecticut out in my dad's new rolls-royce and he said fucking no. so you know what I fucking did? I fucking cut his pinky off and didnt snitch like a little bitch like you. I take lazy ass niggers like you and stomp you with my fat nazi heel. you should be FUCKING sorry you ever fucked with me or my dad (Steve Jobs). And if I find out your using Linux, I'll take pity on thee. Cause you're just too stupi...</td>\n",

Then you put up the quotes of Albert Goldman, a fringe theorist on Elvis Presley, and added them under Graceland#Basement, which is irrelevant.\\nThose \"\"conflicting reports\"\" about his death have no relevance on this article, especially when they are disputed or rejected enough times.\\n This is why this kind of content misleads and should be removed. I don't see any consensus for adding it on archives or previous discussion either.   \"   \n",

       "4       Mr. Wolf,\\nWe need to have a serious talk about Asthma.  Have you done any reading about ASTHMA?  The Beta Adrenergic Theory is the ONLY Theory of Asthma that can be associated with one name {not including crackpots} so your question about other names insults my intelligence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not only that but in contrast to other theories this one has been cited more than any other article in the history of the Journal of Allergy according to the GARFIELED LIBRARY at The University of Pennsylvania. \\nLast but not least, my comment would be out of place in the history section because it relates DIRECTLY to the BA2 polymorphism.  Since other polymorphisms CANNOT be related to a specific theory, much less to a specific individual, your comment doesn't make any sense.   \n",
