It is so cute to see a severely retarded shut-in try out wikipedia and think that she can save it from the communists. Joe Wilson did something never before seen in a joint session of congress, he shit his pants, I mean he yelled at his superior in the military chain of command. You really have to be a low lying pussy to defend a white trash hick. There is a reason the democrats won the election for both congress and the white house, that is why fags like you are left in the dust grabbing on to hilarious conspiracies about the birth certificate and dipshit jesus's death panels.

Given the misuse of tools here and the itchy trigger finger as exemplified by the thread above, this \"\"admin\"\" needs to be examined by Arbcom. I'm not surprised to see a thread already open at ANI discussing it's recent behavioural trends. I won't be initiating anything but will most certainly be presenting evidence at the appropriate time. In the meantime someone needs to tell this \"\"admin\"\" to calm the fuck down and stop removing comments mad by editors on their own talk pages. That's a blockable offence, especially when they were told to never post here again. INVOLVED much?   \"   \n",

Then you put up the quotes of Albert Goldman, a fringe theorist on Elvis Presley, and added them under Graceland#Basement, which is irrelevant.\\nThose \"\"conflicting reports\"\" about his death have no relevance on this article, especially when they are disputed or rejected enough times.\\n This is why this kind of content misleads and should be removed. I don't see any consensus for adding it on archives or previous discussion either.   \"   \n",

Have you done any reading about ASTHMA?  The Beta Adrenergic Theory is the ONLY Theory of Asthma that can be associated with one name {not including crackpots} so your question about other names insults my intelligence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not only that but in contrast to other theories this one has been cited more than any other article in the history of the Journal of Allergy according to the GARFIELED LIBRARY at The University of Pennsylvania. \\nLast but not least, my comment would be out of place in the history section because it relates DIRECTLY to the BA2 polymorphism.  Since other polymorphisms CANNOT be related to a specific theory, much less to a specific individual, your comment doesn't make any sense.   \n",

I can only apologize to the countless people whom I have damaged, especially as I now realize I was acting out of a deep-seated feeling on inadequacy and a desire to be accepted by others. In hindsight it was obvious that I was simply a tragic little girl who wanted to make her mark on the world. I have grown since then, and realized my errors. Please forgive me.   \n",

Remember that these edits take some time, especially with table formatting, ruling sourcing, population totals etc. (this is one reason why I supported adding the remaining states to a table, it would make transfer so much easier).   \n",

       "157562  \"\\n Auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about \"\"luxury vehicle\"\". This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as \"\"luxury\"\" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial. Using self-serving BS in marketing claims is a very, very old invention that helps sell products, as well as fuel the fan base with \"\"bragging\"\" rights to which vehicles are \"\"luxury\"\". On the other hand, it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine. That is why an encyclopedia article has to avoid falling into the trap of using traditional marketing superlatives...   \n",

This means the values in the parentheses eg (15) could be used for the purpose of calculation, but any value that results from such a calculation would not be more accurate than the number of significant figures if those in parentheses were not considered. In other words, the values in parentheses are there to help avoid rounding errors if you’re trying to work to the limit of accuracy of the gas constant. I agree that this is not commonly known, and only confuses the issue. I would recommend removing it.   \n",
